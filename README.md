**- Unix Filesystem
	- [Filesystem overview](https://github.com/FoundCompBio-Spr26/Intro_Week1/blob/main/Filesystems.md)
 	- The Unix root (/)
   		- The very base of the filesystem
     - every full path start at the root
	- Absolute paths
		- All absolute paths begin at the root- start with /
	- Relative paths
		- Don't start with /
		- Working directories
		- Shortcuts for current and parent directories
	- Hidden files and folders
		- Names begin with `.`
		- Usually used for configuration files**
